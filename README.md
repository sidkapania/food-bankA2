##Design Justifications

* *Front End Framework*: We have chosen to use AngularJS as our framework for the development of front end part of our application. This has been useful because it provides features such as 2-way databinding, dependency injection and the use of directives, which allows developers to assign special behaviours to the Document Object Model (DOM).
* *Color Scheme*: The color scheme used for our entire project's pages is the color '#E91E63'. This color helps provide an aesthetic design to our web pages and is also easily identifiable by color blind people too. 
* *Typographic choice*: For this assignment, we have used a google font called Montserrat-Medium of both serif and sans serif type depending on their use.
